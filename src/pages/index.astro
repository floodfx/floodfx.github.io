      I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer with 25 years building startups 
      across ad-tech, ed-tech, construction-tech, climate-tech, and sport-entertainment. 
      I've been fortunate to be part of teams acquired by Google and LinkedIn.

      I believe software is the closest thing we have to magic—especially with 
      machine learning and AI transforming what's possible. Outside of work, 
      I'm passionate about learning, coding, reading, and trying to understand 
      complicated systems.

      Philosophically, I believe in the scientific method, that learning is a 
      function of determination, and that connection to community is critical. 
      I love mountain biking and surfing—activities that demand being 100% present.

      This is my space to put thoughts down on paper and document what I'm 
      currently thinking about. You'll find me watching road bike racing, 
      playing chess (not very well), and always curious about the next thing 
      to learn.
