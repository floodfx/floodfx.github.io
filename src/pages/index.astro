      I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer with 25 years building startups 
      across ad-tech, ed-tech, construction-tech, climate-tech, and sport-entertainment. 
      I've been fortunate to be part of teams acquired by Google and LinkedIn.

      I believe software is the closest thing we have to magicâ€”especially with 
      machine learning and AI transforming what's possible. Outside of work, 
      I'm passionate about learning, coding, reading, and trying to understand 
      complicated systems.

    <p>
      Philosophically, I believe in the scientific method, that learning is a 
      function of determination, and that connection to community is critical.
